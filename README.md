This project was a VHDL code on an FPGA board to simulate a Smart Baby Device.

**Simulated Problem**
Studies show that parents lose 133 nights' worth of sleep before a newborn child turns one.
  - That is 465 hours of sleep lost per parent
  - averaging to an hour and a  half per night
What lack of sleep does to an adult:
  - Impairs memory and decision-making
  - Inflicts anxiety, depression, stress, and paranoia 
  - Decreases the bodyâ€™s immune system
  - Increased risk of chronic health problems
  - Increased risk of injury

**Design Objectives**
Sleeping Environment:
  - Humidity Control: Modulates humidifiers and dehumidifiers to keep the room at an optimal range
  - Temperature Control: Controls cooling and heating units to keep the room at an optimal range

Nap Mode:
  - Audio Player: Turns on nature/white-noise or nursery songs to tune out disruptive noises
  - Rocking Function: If it notices crying or groaning, it will start to rock the crib

Parent Alert: 
  - Alert: If crying continues for an extended amount of time, it will send an alert to the parents
